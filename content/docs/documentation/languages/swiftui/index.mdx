## What is SwiftUI?

Now here’s where things get interesting.

SwiftUI is a framework introduced by Apple in 2019 that allows you to build user interfaces using declarative code — which is very different from how UI was built before with **UIKit** or **AppKit**.

Declarative just means:
"Tell the system what you want the UI to look like — not how to do it step by step."

Example:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
                .font(.title)
            Button("Tap Me") {
                print("Button was tapped")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That’s a full UI layout written in just a few lines.

**VStack** = vertical stack of elements\
**Text** = shows text\
**Button** = clickable button with a simple action

**How is this different from UIKit?**\
Before SwiftUI, you had to write imperative UI code like this:

```swift
let label = UILabel()
label.text = "Hello"

let button = UIButton(type: .system)
button.setTitle("Tap me", for: .normal)
button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(onTap), for: .touchUpInside)
```

With SwiftUI, you think more in components and data binding.

Why SwiftUI is awesome
It works across all Apple platforms

It automatically handles dark mode, accessibility, animations, and more

It plays nicely with Swift's powerful language features

It integrates beautifully with Xcode’s live previews

SwiftUI is still growing — it may not replace UIKit for everything, but it’s now the recommended way to build new apps on Apple platforms.
