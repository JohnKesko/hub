# Containers

Whenver we need to register a service/contex or something, the best way is to do the registration through a container.
When the code base gets large, it will be impossible to maintain and keep track for how many arguments a constructor have after a while.
Therefore, we use a container that returns a service for us whenever we need it.
For example a DbContextService.
