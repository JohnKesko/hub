#### 1. How do computers read the alphabet?

#### 2. The background, in short

#### 3. All letters in the alphabet have a number — but where do those numbers come from?

The history of computer science is beautiful.  
When I first discovered how the ASCII standard was invented, it was truly an _"aha!"_ moment.

Have you seen the ASCII table?

Each character has its own numeric value, usually shown in **decimal** form.  
But how did we come up with these numbers? They can’t just appear from outer space, right?

This is where history comes in.  
Have you heard of Morse code? I assume you have — but what does it have to do with ASCII?

Watch this short video on Morse code to get a feel for how it works. Then come back here, and let’s wrap it all together with ASCII.

It’s beautiful how we humans invented a system to communicate using a **single tone** over **electricity**, one letter at a time.

So, how does ASCII relate to all this?

Well, the roots go back quite a bit — but ASCII as we know it was invented at **Bell Labs** in the early 1960s.  
It was designed to improve how **teleprinters** communicated, and it introduced a **7-bit** format to encode characters.

> Interestingly, while ASCII became the official internet standard in 2015, it’s been around for **decades** before that — quietly powering much of computing history.
