Fun project! Implemented it some time ago in plain HTML, CSS and JS.<br />

It's a effective pathfinding algorithm that is widely used in many applications. I think even Google Maps uses it to find the shortest path between two points. <br />
The algorithm is based on a heuristic approach, which means it uses a combination of the actual cost to reach a node and an estimated cost to reach the goal. <br />

It is more efficient than other algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, especially in large graphs. <br />
