#### Super interesting project.<br />

I had this idea for a while, but I never had the time to implement it. <br />
The main reason was work related. I had to share some sensitive data with my coworkers, but I didn't want to use any third party service + I wanted to have the control myself.<br />

It's currently in beta. It needs some refinement for the UX but the main idea is there. <br />

#### How it works:

1. You add some text or text + file you want to share<br />
2. You select the expiration time (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month) or whatever you want<br />
3. Optional: Set **One-Time Link** or **Multi use**.<br />

   - One-Time Link - the link will be destroyed after it's first fetch.<br />
   - Multi use - the link will be deleted after the expiration time.

4. Optional: Set password and/or IP-restrictions
5. Click "Generate" and copy the link.

### Tech stack:

- Next.js for the frontend and backend.
- NeonTech for DB
- Redis for caching
- AWS S3 for file storage
